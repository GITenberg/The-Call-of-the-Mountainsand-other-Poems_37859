<P CLASS="poem">
Under the shade of the Kursaal veranda<BR>
Idly I follow the flight of the seagulls,<BR>
Gleaming like snow when their wings catch the sunshine,<BR>
While from the palm-house adjacent is wafted<BR>
Music half drowned in a babel of voices,<BR>
Fitting the mode of this temple of follies.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Far though the mountains, their influence, ever<BR>
Changeful in temper, from sombre to smiling,<BR>
Constant in wileful and mystic allurement,<BR>
Rouses unrest and a strange fascination.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Limpid and blue are the waters of Leman<BR>
Clear in the deepness, translucent and shining,<BR>
Blue as the ether's ineffable azure,<BR>
Bright in the glow of the midsummer sunshine.<BR>
Cleaving the air with their palpitant pinions,<BR>
Wheeling and drifting, the beautiful seagulls<BR>
Fly with the grace of unconscious perfection,<BR>
Crying exultant and wild in a chorus.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Are you not fit for the realm of immortals,<BR>
To float on the winds of the gardens Elysian?<BR>
Or must you hover a little while longer&mdash;<BR>
Wandering souls in a state of probation&mdash;<BR>
Half-way uplifted beyond our defilement,<BR>
Half-way removed from the land of the blessed?<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Far in the distance beyond the blue water,<BR>
Rises the hoary old father of mountains,<BR>
Rugged and scarred with antiquity's furrows,<BR>
Crowned with the snows of a million winters.<BR>
Low in the shade of his ponderous presence,<BR>
Dappling the slopes, are the homesteads of peasants,<BR>
Each with its cloud of blue vapour ascending:<BR>
And sweetly the bells across the green pastures<BR>
Answer each other with voices persistent,<BR>
Telling the herdsman the tale of his charges.<BR>
Grim is the smile of the white-headed mountain<BR>
For toilers below in the slumbering valley,<BR>
Grim is the glance with a touch of derision,<BR>
Seeming to say to his towering brothers&mdash;<BR>
Catogne and the broad-shouldered heights of the Midi,<BR>
"Iguanodon,&mdash;Mastodon,&mdash;Man,&mdash;in their passing<BR>
Serve but as signs on the path of the ages."<BR>
Softly the plash of the waters of Leman<BR>
Sounds from the rough-tumbled stones at its margin:<BR>
Gently the zephyrs play over its surface,<BR>
Making it glitter with myriads of sparklets.<BR>
Swiftly the barques trim their sails in the sunshine&mdash;<BR>
Sails high and slender that swell to the breezes,<BR>
White as the snow on the breast of the Jungfrau&mdash;<BR>
Mirrored in whiteness upon the blue water.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
As I sat watching the lake and the mountains,<BR>
Slowly a haze like a curtain of muslin,<BR>
Flimsy and fine like a texture of cobweb,<BR>
Drifted and rose till it shut out the bases<BR>
And bulk of the mountains across the still water,<BR>
Whilst high above it the crests and sierras<BR>
Stood out as castles and walls of enchantment,<BR>
Raised in the air like king Solomon's city,<BR>
Held up aloft by invisible genii.<BR>
Then in the faintly drawn lines of escarpment,<BR>
Battlements, pinnacles, turrets and bastions<BR>
Sprang into being, and fancy, untrammelled,<BR>
Pictured a palace with walls, and a fortress<BR>
Beleaguered and stormed by a shadowy army,<BR>
Massed under pennons seen dim through the vapour.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Over the drawbridge a desperate sortie<BR>
Made by the knights of the castle invested<BR>
Brings the foes quickly in conflict together.<BR>
Plumes white and restless like foam on the breakers<BR>
Drift to and fro with the tide of the battle;<BR>
Falchions and maces and curtaxes gleaming<BR>
A moment aloft, strike sparks in descending<BR>
On corslet and casque and dinted escutcheon,<BR>
Whilst out of the contest, with stumbling footsteps<BR>
The wounded are led sore stricken and helpless.<BR>
Ladies in sarcenet, arabesque broidered<BR>
With blossoms that climb fantastic in colour,&mdash;<BR>
Stiff flowers of blazonry's formal convention<BR>
That rise from the hem to the throat in profusion,<BR>
Where carcanets flash on bosoms unquiet,&mdash;<BR>
Look from their casements with eyes full of wonder,<BR>
Down on the conflict that rages below them,<BR>
Fierce in the shock and the heat of encounter,<BR>
Hearing the war-cries and clashing of weapons,<BR>
Winding of horns, and the groans of the dying.<BR>
Till all was lost in the thickening curtain,<BR>
Veiled by the mist were my golden romances.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Once when a snowstorm swept over lake Leman<BR>
Filling the distance with wildly tossed snowflakes,<BR>
I pictured a scene in the heart of the mountains,<BR>
Hidden in shadows, unknown to the climber,<BR>
Out of the range of Humanity's footsteps.<BR>
There is the cave where the slumbering ice god<BR>
Hides from the gaze of the wandering stranger,<BR>
Shut in the depths of the mountain's recesses,<BR>
Rent long ago by the force of upheavals<BR>
In the wild turmoil and labour of earthquake.<BR>
There sits the god of the cold everlasting,<BR>
Guarding the spirits of men who have perished<BR>
In their endeavours to master the secrets<BR>
Of paths that have never by footsteps been trodden.<BR>
In the ice temple his figure majestic<BR>
Looms from a throne that through aeons uncounted<BR>
Has stood in the gloom and the silence eternal.<BR>
Weird is the throng of the spirits in thraldom:<BR>
Silent they steal from their icy sepulture,<BR>
Slow-pacing figures unchanged and unchanging:<BR>
By violent death, swift, ruthless and lonely,<BR>
Sentenced to wander for ever in darkness,<BR>
Pent in the masterful ice god's dominion.<BR>
Primitive hunters with flint-headed arrows,<BR>
Whose limited minds ignored the distinction<BR>
Engendered by knowledge, of good and of evil:<BR>
Acting by impulse and guided by instinct:<BR>
Living in caves like the bears and the foxes,<BR>
Facing with cunning and courage their quarry,<BR>
Guarding their women and feeding their children,<BR>
Almost as fierce as the creatures they hunted.<BR>
Men who came later throughout the long ages,<BR>
Wandering fugitives driven by fortune<BR>
Far from their homes to the wild desolation,<BR>
Slaves of illusion that lures to destruction:<BR>
Some with a love for adventure and daring,<BR>
Some to escape from the ills that pursued them,<BR>
Some in response to the strong fascination<BR>
That calls from the heights of the untrodden mountains,<BR>
All destined by fate, that watches unceasing,<BR>
To die in the darkness forgotten for ever,<BR>
Pent in the ice god's immutable kingdom.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Wafted by breezes, my white-sailed felucca<BR>
Slipped through the blueness to where the grim stronghold<BR>
Of Chillon keeps ever in grateful remembrance<BR>
The patriot Bonivard, champion of freedom.<BR>
The pillar of pain where, writhing in torment,<BR>
The captives were scourged at cruelty's bidding,<BR>
Is still to be seen, an eloquent witness.<BR>
Tenantless now is the cavernous dungeon<BR>
Where wretches awaited through darkness unending<BR>
The dawn of their last and dreaded to-morrow.<BR>
Stripped of its horrors, the chamber of torture<BR>
Echoes no more to the shrieks of its victims,<BR>
And death's grim abode where agony ended<BR>
Is free from the crimes that redden its records.<BR>
There by the column of stone in the dungeon<BR>
Where Bonivard lay to pine through the seasons<BR>
Of six weary years, I mused on his story.<BR>
Undaunted by death's ever-threatening shadow,<BR>
Unconquered though insolent tyranny triumphed,<BR>
Chilled in the summer and frozen in winter,<BR>
Famished, neglected and loaded with fetters,<BR>
Yet borne up within by courage unflinching,<BR>
Supported by Faith when Hope had departed,<BR>
Scorning to murmur, he waited with patience.<BR>
Morning's faint light through the narrow embrasure,<BR>
The wandering cry of a sea-mew in freedom<BR>
Heightened the gloom of his roughly hewn prison,<BR>
Making a summons to death a deliverance.<BR>
Night fell about him in Stygian darkness,<BR>
While the faint lap of the waters of Leman,<BR>
Beating the ramparts with madding persistence,<BR>
Whispered despair in the still isolation.<BR>
What were his thoughts when the vault of his prison<BR>
Rang with glad cries in the glare of the torches?<BR>
Breaking the silence, dispelling the shadows<BR>
That darkened his life and threatened his reason,<BR>
What were his thoughts at the moment of freedom?<BR>
When round him a tempest of passion was raging,<BR>
An unloosened storm of passionate feeling,<BR>
When men incoherent and hoarse from the conflict<BR>
Fought for the honour of breaking his fetters,<BR>
Leaving him breathless with hearty embraces,<BR>
Weak and unmanned in the sudden revulsion,<BR>
Carried away by the flood of emotion,<BR>
With something unknown that stifled expression,<BR>
That silenced his voice and heaved in his bosom.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Strong is the spell of the dream-haunted mountains,<BR>
Ruddy with gold in the glory of sunrise,<BR>
Purple and silver and blue in the daytime,<BR>
Tinged by the amethyst splendours of sunset,<BR>
Gloomy, majestic and dark in the twilight,<BR>
Mystic by moonlight, ethereal, airy,<BR>
Changeful and fickle in hues as the opal,<BR>
Under the mutable lights and the shadows,<BR>
Ever alluring with subtle attraction.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Far, far away are the waters of Leman<BR>
Whence I have fled at the call of the mountains.<BR>
Here in the valley where rushes a torrent,<BR>
Constant and cold, be it summer or winter,<BR>
A village lies hid and hither the climbers,<BR>
Strangely alike in their eager impatience,<BR>
Wearing the look of enwrapped expectation,<BR>
Pause ere they start on their perilous journey.<BR>
Hemming me round, the implacable mountains<BR>
Shut out the world and confine me in durance,<BR>
Bending my soul to the yoke of their bondage,<BR>
Dwarfing my self and my little emotions,<BR>
Waking desire to escape limitations<BR>
And barriers imposed by narrow horizons.<BR>
Rugged, majestic, they tower above me,<BR>
As lonely and pensive I gaze in the torrent,<BR>
Wondering now at the summons insistent,<BR>
No longer in dreams and rovings of fancy,<BR>
But weighted with impulse, defying resistance,<BR>
Rousing unrest like a spirit of evil.<BR>
So, as I linger awhile in the village,<BR>
Completely I know each day brings me nearer<BR>
To what lies beyond, in the regions of silence.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Now it is over.  The lights of the village,<BR>
The children at play, the clink from the smithy,<BR>
The gurgle and rush of the hurrying torrent,<BR>
The rattle of wheels, the tinkle of cowbells,<BR>
The inn's open window whence converse in fragments<BR>
Floats out with the odours of beer and tobacco,<BR>
All welcome me back with familiar voices.<BR>
Here time moves onward with rhythmic precision:<BR>
Breakfast and dinner, and bed for the darkness,<BR>
With Sunday to part one week from another:<BR>
Spring time and winter, the snow and the sunshine,<BR>
And sooner or later a cross in the churchyard.<BR>
Time lacks proportion away in the mountains.<BR>
What is a day or an hour or a lifetime<BR>
Gauged by the ebb and the flow of the ages<BR>
Shown in the tidemarks on crags prehistoric?<BR>
If, as men say, time is measured by heartbeats,<BR>
I wandered through years of vivid emotions.<BR>
Pelion and Ossa, by arrogant Titans<BR>
Profanely uplifted to challenge Olympus,<BR>
Repeated themselves in the blueness above me.<BR>
Sunsets and dawns such as glowed on the marshes,<BR>
Silurian haunts of the early creation,<BR>
Long ere the age of humanity's advent,<BR>
Gleamed through the vapours and red exhalations<BR>
Rising from bottomless pits to encolour<BR>
Weirdly the matrix, volcanic, primeval,<BR>
Riven and torn in the birth-throes of Cosmos.<BR>
Slippery ledges uneven and narrow,<BR>
Through rarefied air that maddens the pulses,<BR>
Treacherous footpaths inviting destruction,<BR>
Where fear in the heart disorders the senses.<BR>
Vertiginate chasms, abysmal, terrific,<BR>
Unfathomed and sheer with never a foothold,<BR>
Compelling the gaze with cold fascination.<BR>
Stretches of billowy acres of whiteness<BR>
Dimming the eyes with their endless expanses;<BR>
Ridges upstanding in ice walls cemented<BR>
By glacial pressure of slow-moving masses.<BR>
Caverns with ice shapes, blue-tinted, translucent:<BR>
Columns and altars and figures fantastic,<BR>
Imagined in dreams or pictured in fever,<BR>
Softly illumed by the moonlight's reflection.<BR>
There is the haunt of the evil ice maidens,<BR>
The servants of Death, who lure with their beauty,<BR>
Who bathe in the stream of the glacier water,<BR>
The glacial water that flows through the caverns,<BR>
Silent and deep as the river of Lethe.<BR>
These memories hold me.  I live in a fever.<BR>
The air that I breathe, the influence round me<BR>
Are charged with a strange and volatile essence<BR>
That throbs in my veins and quickens my breathing.<BR>
Held by the mountains, I languish in bondage<BR>
Under the masterful sway of their presence.<BR>
Restless though weary I dream of their perils,<BR>
Slipping down chasms with death at the bottom,<BR>
Or over the desolate ice fields I wander,<BR>
Hopeless, forgotten and lost in the snowdrifts,<BR>
Wandering ever past hope of redemption.<BR>
Sometimes I swing with a pendulum's measure,<BR>
Fitfully swayed by the wind o'er a chasm<BR>
That gapes far below, relentless and cruel,<BR>
Conscious of all in the terrible moments<BR>
That pass till I drop to the doom that is waiting<BR>
Far in the depths of the yawning crevasses,<BR>
And wake at the instant supreme of destruction.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
To-morrow at dawn I fly from the village<BR>
Back to the peace of the waters of Leman.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Gone, gone at last, is the morbid obsession!<BR>
Gone to the shade in the regions of Limbo.<BR>
Far, far away, o'er the waters of Leman,<BR>
Mistily outlined and faint in the distance,<BR>
Threatening no longer, the dream-haunted mountains<BR>
Lazily whisper of rest and contentment.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Softly the plash of the glittering fountain<BR>
Falls on the night with the scent of mimosa,<BR>
Mingled with polyglot phrases and laughter,<BR>
Marking the pause 'twixt a waltz and mazurka.<BR>
Soft are the lamps in the Kursaal rotunda<BR>
Lighting discreetly the hall of lost footsteps<BR>
Whose gleaming mosaics are painted with garlands,<BR>
Blossoms exotic, luxuriant, languid,<BR>
Red as the souls of the people about them,<BR>
Hinting at passions through crimson and purple,<BR>
Fitting the vogue of this temple of pleasure.<BR>
On a divan in the hall where the idlers<BR>
Promenade slowly, in converse together,<BR>
I sit all alone in calm contemplation,<BR>
Hearing the orchestra faint in the distance<BR>
And the croupier's voice from his chamber seductive,<BR>
Parrot-like crying in stale iteration,<BR>
Summons and challenge across the green table.<BR>
Keen-eyed old gamesters who prowl round the players,<BR>
Seeking a pigeon to pluck at their leisure:<BR>
Black-whiskered barons with blurred reputations<BR>
Smirking at B. and his girls from Chicago:<BR>
Swaggering captains at best detrimental:<BR>
A country-bred youth just come to a fortune,<BR>
Trying in vain to conceal his amazement:<BR>
Couples awaiting the Absolute's fiat,<BR>
Now in pursuit of a flying illusion:<BR>
Hebrews from Frankfort and bankers from Paris<BR>
Chatting to ladies resplendent in diamonds;<BR>
A burgess of London whose wife says: "Disgraceful,"<BR>
But lingers to study Parisian fashions:<BR>
Gamblers inveterate bent to a system,<BR>
Silent, unheeding, absorbed in their figures:<BR>
Well-groomed young fellows, light-hearted and careless,<BR>
Come for the dance and the fun of flirtation,<BR>
Bright-eyed and merry, unconsciously breathing<BR>
The poisonous air of sepulchres whited.<BR>
Perdita, watchful and guardedly smiling,<BR>
Trying to lessen the distance between us,<BR>
Wafts me a sign with a spray of verbena.<BR>
Is she an angel, a beast or a demon,<BR>
Or spirit incarnate that onward is passing<BR>
To higher avatars by long transmigration?<BR>
Ah! how it warms one, this human deflection,<BR>
This touch with familiar follies and foibles,<BR>
After the limitless space of the aeons,<BR>
Out of the measure of time as we know it,<BR>
Far in the distant and echoless ages,<BR>
Austere, and untouched by our passing emotions,<BR>
Where I have wandered in lonely remoteness<BR>
Under the passionless spell of the mountains.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Cold and relentless, eternally lasting!<BR>
Silent inscriptions in cryptical cipher!<BR>
Unbroken record of time since creation,<BR>
Whose secret is hid from human conception.<BR>
How small are the things humanity prizes,<BR>
The feverish joys of passion and pleasure,<BR>
That pass like a dream to dusky oblivion!<BR>
How short is man's life compared with the ages<BR>
That frown from the face of the mystical mountains,<BR>
Far in the blue o'er the waters of Leman.<BR>

  The Old Manor House
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
The rusted gates whose forgings fine<BR>
Enlace a gilded coronet,<BR>
Now dim in lustreless decline,<BR>
Groaned as I passed the lichened shapes<BR>
Of rampant griffin on each side,<BR>
Stiff with heraldic, stony pride.<BR>
Then through the grass-grown drive I passed<BR>
With ancient oaks on either hand,<BR>
Throwing their shadows dark and vast<BR>
Upon the bracken at their feet<BR>
Where rabbits peeped in fear and ran<BR>
From the rare sound of living man.<BR>
For here no more the sumptuous train<BR>
Displays the pomp of falconry;<BR>
No more, besprent with mire and rain,<BR>
The messenger-at-arms rides in:<BR>
Nor, with his retinue of knights<BR>
Some great man at the house alights.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Above the portico<BR>
Of the great silent house,<BR>
The quarterings' tinctures glow,<BR>
Blazoning its history,<BR>
From the old Sieur de Caulx,<BR>
Whose heavy Norman sword<BR>
Helped Harold's overthrow,<BR>
And whose long line of sons<BR>
Stretches, like a shadow,<BR>
Thrown in the eventide,<BR>
Through the old folio<BR>
Where illumined pages<BR>
Bravely the records show,<BR>
Till the last, lonely heir<BR>
Was carried down below,<BR>
To the cold marble vaults<BR>
A century ago.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
A gallery o'erlooks the hall,<BR>
A gallery where minstrels played<BR>
And with their lutes sweet music made,<BR>
While from the weapons on the wall,<BR>
Reflected shone the lights that glowed<BR>
Above the hospitable board<BR>
When each successive, generous lord<BR>
His loyalty or grandeur showed.<BR>
Kings feasted there with stately dames,<BR>
Ambassadors and Cardinals<BR>
Who, cheered with wine and madrigals,<BR>
Fed with their fancies amorous flames.<BR>
And at some great eventful scene<BR>
Full many a dance the chamber graced,<BR>
Pavanes and sarabands were paced,<BR>
And minuets when Anne was queen.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
My footsteps echoing from the panelled walls,<BR>
Stayed the long sleep of years,<BR>
Stirring the thick, accumulated dust<BR>
To movement in the ray of light that falls,<BR>
From a half-shuttered oriel which appears<BR>
Between the rafters, just<BR>
Where a stone mullion its carved apex rears.<BR>
Faint voices whispered round me as I stood<BR>
Spellbound and listening there:<BR>
The ghostly strains of melodies forgot,<BR>
The happy laughter of fair womanhood:<BR>
Children in noisy play, without a care:<BR>
Fierce cries with passion hot,<BR>
Triumphant some, and some wild with despair.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Leaving the chamber so haunted by voices,<BR>
Fearful, I hastened to where the great staircase<BR>
Rears its proud height in a double ascension<BR>
Till it is hid in the deepening shadows.<BR>
Stiffly upstanding on each chief baluster,<BR>
Absently gaze the historical griffins,<BR>
Plunged in their silent and deep meditation.<BR>
Many a Caulx have they seen pass before them,<BR>

The steward, from the all-pervading gloom,<BR>
Flung wide the shutters of the drawing-room,<BR>

Lit by the summer's radiating sheen.<BR>
The room's magnificence, its noble size<BR>

A costly pierglass in its tarnished frame,<BR>

Pendent, with ten score sconces silver chased,<BR>
From the high ceiling which a master graced<BR>
With courtly scenes wherein could be descried<BR>
Ancestral figures in their pomp and pride.<BR>
The sunlight played on gilded girandole,<BR>
On silver candlestick and stiff console,<BR>
All of that period when here befell<BR>
The scene on which the steward loves to dwell,<BR>
Showing the floor's dark stain of sombre red<BR>
And how it came about that blood was shed.<BR>
I marked the punchbowls, full of leaves and dust,<BR>
A slim sword, silver-hiked, flecked with rust:<BR>
A daintily escutcheoned chiffonier,<BR>
Inlaid with shell and finished with veneer:<BR>
Timepieces silent, set in ormolu:<BR>
The damask screens of faded red and blue.<BR>

It seemed conclusive to us students then.<BR>
The man's prestige had weight.  Authority<BR>
Made him for us above all other men;<BR>
He was the head of our academy.<BR>
His calm assumption and incisive way,<BR>
Admitting no alternative nor doubt,<BR>
As he intoned his long familiar lay,<BR>
Made his pronouncements clear as if cut out<BR>
Of crystal, cold with mathematic test,<BR>
Through which he viewed complacently the span<BR>

Quite heedless of the growing range of man.<BR>
His narrow field so finished and complete,<BR>
His standards and his logic's hampering line<BR>

Converging in a new horizon's shine.<BR>
All this was years ago.  What would he say,<BR>

See space and pain reduced to minimus,<BR>
Electric currents hand in hand with steam,<BR>
Men borne in ships across the trackless air,<BR>
The widening story of the earth's old scheme<BR>
Told in its strata, and, with arduous care,<BR>
The age of man thrust back unfathomed years,<BR>
New elements, a new chronology<BR>
And growing lore that year by year appears<BR>
To show how distant is finality?<BR>
It sets my fancy roving and I try<BR>
In idle hours to think what may befall.<BR>
Naught seems impossible, no thought too high,<BR>
No dream too mad, to realise it all.<BR>
What, for example, is the human mind?<BR>
Whence comes it, great or small, at some man's birth?<BR>
A fool's or sage's, base or all refined!<BR>
What holds it till his body turns to earth?<BR>
And whither goes it with the failing breath?<BR>
And is the Aura's essence to remain<BR>
Ever elusive at the hour of death,<BR>
To perish or another home attain?<BR>
Or, with close knowledge of man's growing germ,<BR>
Shall we not train it and direct its course,<BR>
As now we cultivate the floral sperm,<BR>
And simple weeds to complex beauty force?<BR>
Life is a thing of phases manifold,<BR>
By shades diminishing from high to low,<BR>
Man, protoplasm, beast, all we are told,<BR>
To perish in an equal overthrow.<BR>
Our view of life at best is incomplete.<BR>
We judge by its effect and action, blind<BR>
To its real essence, as to that we meet,<BR>
Acting unseen, when wire to wire we bind.<BR>
Think of what might be, once this secret known,<BR>
Full knowledge of Life's spark, and with the power<BR>
To rescue from Death's dark and silent zone<BR>
The souls of some great men whose natures tower<BR>
Above their fellows and can ill be spared<BR>
From some great task far-reaching and benign.<BR>
I hear a reader say: "This man has dared<BR>
"To claim for us an attribute divine!<BR>
"Our times are in God's hands."  And I reply:<BR>
We do not hesitate to take a life,<BR>
The claims of social law to satisfy,<BR>
And punish men whose minds with crime are rife.<BR>
What then more fitting, given the knowledge there,<BR>
To lengthen lives that worthy ends fulfil,<BR>
And measure by new standards just and fair<BR>
The worth of life as it is good or ill?<BR>
Have we exhausted chemistry's domain?<BR>
Squeezed dry the elements we say we know?<BR>
And does the spinning universe contain<BR>
No more our theories to overthrow?<BR>
How far does gravitation serve our needs&mdash;<BR>
The force that keeps each planet in its place,<BR>
Resistless, constant, yet with varying speeds,<BR>
For ever acting in unbounded space?<BR>
Some day perhaps pent man will learn to brave<BR>
An alien atmosphere, and, from afar,<BR>

Bring us new wisdom from some distant star.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
While yet the Saxons ruled, a puissant Thane<BR>
Made with his unkempt band of mounted spears<BR>
A seizin of a hide of forest land<BR>
Whereon he built a house of ample size,<BR>
With dining-hall and bowers and sleeping-lofts,<BR>
And stables shutting in a stone-paved yard:<BR>
And round the whole he set a ponderous fence<BR>
Of sharpened stakes fast bound with metal bands.<BR>
And "Yan, the Wulf," for thus the Thane was known,<BR>
Called the place "Wulfden" in his savage tongue.<BR>
And here, year after year, he lived at ease,<BR>
Oft making sallies for a cattle raid,<BR>
Or fighting with some other such as he,<BR>
To come back weary at the fall of night,<BR>
Driving a herd before him, and his men<BR>
Sweating beneath the spoil of plundered foes.<BR>
Once as he sat at supper in his hall,<BR>
Bemused with mead and satisfied with food,<BR>
There came a wandering bedesman to his gate<BR>
Craving permission "in Fayre Jesu's name"<BR>
To build a church of stone within the shade<BR>
Of his protection.  And, in generous mood,<BR>
The Thane gave gruff assent; and time slipped by.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Then William swept the land, and, to reward<BR>
One of his knights, gave him the Wulf's demesne<BR>
To hold in fee, and on the Saxon's land<BR>
Arose a fortress with embattled walls,<BR>
With donjon, keep and moat and tilting-yard,<BR>
To hold in thraldom all the country-side.<BR>
But still was left the little Saxon church,<BR>
Unchanged save that the Norman owner gave<BR>
New consecration in his patron's name,<BR>
St. Martinus of Tours, a warrior saint<BR>
Who guarded through the centuries his race.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Then in the War of Roses came the crash<BR>
That brought extinction to the feudal name<BR>

The little church of Saxon days remained<BR>
The emblem of a never-dying faith.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
The years rolled by and then there came a day<BR>
Which gave a new possessor to the place,<BR>
A nobleman in favour with that queen<BR>

When coupled with good looks and brave attire.<BR>
He built a great Elizabethan pile,<BR>
The ground-plan shaped to form the royal E,<BR>
Conforming to the fashion of the times<BR>
When loyalty spoke even from silent stone.<BR>
And he, to please his lady's pious whim,<BR>
(Though ten years wed, he called her Sweetheart still)<BR>
Forbore to raze the chapel to the ground,<BR>
But stayed with flying buttress either side,<BR>
Repaired the roof and made it to her mind.<BR>
And there they lie, both in one marble tomb<BR>
On which their effigies with clasping hands<BR>
Bear witness to an everlasting love.<BR>

one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you

rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
